Diabetes Diagnosis Machine Learning Model - 2021

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can effectively diagnose diabetes based on various health metrics. The model was trained using real-world data and aims to assist in early detection of diabetes, offering an accessible and efficient tool for healthcare providers.

The project consists of three main stages:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
Model Training: Implementing a machine learning algorithm for classification.
Model Evaluation: Testing the modelâ€™s performance using various metrics.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database on Kaggle. It contains several important features such as:

Number of pregnancies
Glucose level
Blood pressure
Skin thickness
Insulin level
BMI
Diabetes pedigree function
Age
The target label is binary, representing whether a person has diabetes (1) or not (0).

Model
1. Algorithm
The primary machine learning algorithm used in this project is Logistic Regression, chosen for its interpretability and simplicity. However, alternative models like Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were also tested to find the optimal solution.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values through imputation.
Standardized the feature values to ensure uniformity in scale.
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for model evaluation.
3. Model Training
Used Scikit-Learn library for implementing the Logistic Regression and other machine learning models.
Cross-validation was performed to ensure robustness.
4. Evaluation Metrics
The model was evaluated based on:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved the following results on the test set:

Accuracy: 78%
Precision: 76%
Recall: 74%
F1 Score: 75%
Installation
